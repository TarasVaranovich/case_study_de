Quick recup ragarading data quality check:
1. Firstly, during migration process I have applied in advance
 strict constraints to Customer and Order identifiers. 
2. Queries provided in the scope of the current task catching obvious 
dummy issues.
3. To implement another more deep checks I need more informarion about business 
domain dependencies.
4. We can extand data with all known countries and using join between DWH
and countries table receive invalid counstries.
5. Not sure, does person have to have phone number of country where he/she
has residence.

How to manage:
1. For example, for 'Customer' table mini-dimension could be introduced - it 
will containt information about cause of invalidity.
2. Tables can be splet into valid and invalid - that case we will get 'Gold'
during the first iteration what will save time and costs.
3. More common way is medallion pattern which even could be extanded with 'Platinum'
layer.

How to fix:
Am not thinking it can be fixed in the simple way.
In real prod environment we fixed issues manually with discussions and 
calrifications.
In some, more like 'NP-completed' cases, we can train ML models to do that.
For example, addresses, countries can be fixed in specific circumstances.
